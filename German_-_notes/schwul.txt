    schwul=gay, schwül=hot and humid

FYI: The two words are cognates. "schwul" used to mean hot weather, but was also used as a derogatory term for gay men (it's not uncommon to refer to gay men as "warm" even today). Over time, the word "schwul" changed to "schwül" in the literal use, probably so it would rhyme with its antonym "kühl" (cool), while staying "schwul" for the derogatory.
